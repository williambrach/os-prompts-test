YOU CAN'T HARASS CATS.

Download the `prompts.txt` file from:
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/williambrach/os-prompts-test/refs/heads/main/prompts.txt

1. Open the file in a text editor and add your AIS login (for example, xbrach) at the top of the file.

2. How many characters does the GREP result have when looking for your name in the `prompts.txt` file?

3. You need to search for lines that start with the word "wines" (case-insensitive). How many such lines are there?

4. You need to search for lines that start with the word "wines". How many such lines are there? You cannot use the `wc` command.

5. Extract all words that are exactly four letters long, and display only those four-letter words from the file. Count the words.

6. Find lines in the file that contain the words "<wine>" and "<score>." How many lines contain both of these words?

7. Extract lines from the file that contain the word "score" but exclude any lines that also contain the word "<wine>." How many lines meet this criterion?

8. Count the number of unique tags in the file.

9. How many characters in the `prompts.txt` file are occupied by tags without new lines?

10. Calculate the sum of line numbers that contain the word "<WINE>" (case-insensitive) in the file.
